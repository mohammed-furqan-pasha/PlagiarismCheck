MinHash is a technique for quickly estimating how similar two sets are. It is based on the Jaccard similarity coefficient, which measures the intersection size divided by the union size of two sets. This estimation is highly probabilistic and is much faster than calculating the true Jaccard similarity for very large sets. The technique involves randomly permuting the elements of the sets and using the minimum element of the permuted sets as a hash value. The probability that the MinHash values for two sets are equal is exactly the Jaccard similarity of the two sets.

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is often paired with MinHash. LSH is a powerful indexing scheme used for finding approximate nearest neighbors in high-dimensional data. The core idea is to "hash" input items so that similar items map to the same "bucket" with high probability. This drastically reduces the number of pairs that need to be checked for similarity, making large-scale data matching feasible. In the context of MinHash, the MinHash signatures are partitioned into bands, and collision in any band suggests a potential match.

Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is a modification of the BERT network architecture that uses a siamese and triplet network structure to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. These embeddings can be compared using cosine similarity to determine the semantic similarity of two sentences. Unlike standard BERT, which produces high-quality token embeddings, SBERT is specifically optimized to produce high-quality, fixed-size sentence embeddings, making it ideal for tasks like clustering and semantic search.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that may not fit in RAM. It provides state-of-the-art performance, especially when dealing with the high-dimensional vectors produced by models like SBERT. FAISS uses indexing structures, such as IndexFlatL2 for simple Euclidean distance checking, and more complex structures like IndexIVFFlat for compression and faster querying.
